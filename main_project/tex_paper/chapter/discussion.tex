Although quite successful the results of the machine learning methods do not give one much insight into the 'mechanical' workings of the MHC binding.
We did try, without much success, to find correlation between different locations in the binding peptides using Spearman rank correlation.
For some peptides, BLOSUM encoding with a four
neuron hidden layer can best predict the
peptide/MHC binding, for other peptides a sparse
encoded network with zero hidden neurons performs
the best.
As stated in the class exercise slides, the ANN's seem to have a bad reputation. 
It is our guess that the good performance of ANN's in this case is because they are well suited to the MHC peptide binding problem. 
Also the correct use of ANN's in terms of overfitting is an helping factor.
