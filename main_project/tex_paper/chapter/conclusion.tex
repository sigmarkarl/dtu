%Conclusion
As to be expected the prediction performance of the machine learning algorithms was better when trained on the larger datasets.
Also a great difference in the number of binding vs non-binding peptides generally degraded the performance.
The trend for the larger datasets was the 10 hidden-layer non-blosum matrix encoded data was performing best. 
This could demonstrate that the large datasets are covering more the space of binding/non-binding data and training without using blosum matrix encoding is more accurate.
It is a little difficult to see from the graphs but for the small datasets, using the blosum matrix increased the predictive performance.
For some peptides, BLOSUM encoding with a four
neuron hidden layer can best predict the
peptide/MHC binding, for other peptides a sparse
encoded network with zero hidden neurons performs
the best.
