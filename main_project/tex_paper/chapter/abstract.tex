%\section{Summary}

The identification of MHC binding peptides for consideration as potential T-cell epitopes has application in peptide vaccine design and immunotherapy. 
Determination of MHC binding using experimental measures is time-consuming and expensive. 
Therefore, efficient prediction models are required that facilitate systematic computational scanning of microbial genome for candidate T cell epitopes. 
These prediction models are either sequence or structure based. 
This review provides a comparative analysis on machine learing methods support vector machine (SVM) and artificial neural networks (ANN).
