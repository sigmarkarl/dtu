abstract = {The Weka machine learning workbench provides a general-purpose environment for automatic classification, regression, clustering and feature selection-common data mining problems in bioinformatics research. It contains an extensive collection of machine learning algorithms and data pre-processing methods complemented by graphical user interfaces for data exploration and the experimental comparison of different machine learning techniques on the same problem. Weka can process data given in the form of a single relational table. Its main objectives are to (a) assist users in extracting useful information from data and (b) enable them to easily identify a suitable algorithm for generating an accurate predictive model from it.

abstract = {Identification of MHC binding peptides is essential for understanding the molecular mechanism of immune response. However, most of the prediction methods use motifs/profiles derived from experimental peptide binding data for specific MHC alleles, thus limiting their applicability only to those alleles for which such data is available. In this work we have developed a structure-based method which does not require experimental peptide binding data for training. Our method models MHC-peptide complexes using crystal structures of 170 MHC-peptide complexes and evaluates the binding energies using two well known residue based statistical pair potentials, namely Betancourt-Thirumalai (BT) and Miyazawa-Jernigan (MJ) matrices. Extensive benchmarking of prediction accuracy on a data set of 1654 epitopes from class I and class II alleles available in the SYFPEITHI database indicate that BT pair-potential can predict more than 60\% of the known binders in case of 14 MHC alleles with AUC values for ROC curves ranging from 0.6 to 0.9. Similar benchmarking on 29,522 class I and class II MHC binding peptides with known IC(50) values in the IEDB database showed AUC values higher than 0.6 for 10 class I alleles and 9 class II alleles in predictions involving classification of a peptide to be binder or non-binder. Comparison with recently available benchmarking studies indicated that, the prediction accuracy of our method for many of the class I and class II MHC alleles was comparable to the sequence based methods, even if it does not use any experimental data for training. It is also encouraging to note that the ranks of true binding peptides could further be improved, when high scoring peptides obtained from pair potential were re-ranked using all atom forcefield and MM/PBSA method.},

abstract = {NetMHC-3.0 is trained on a large number of quantitative peptide data using both affinity data from the Immune Epitope Database and Analysis Resource (IEDB) and elution data from SYFPEITHI. The method generates high-accuracy predictions of major histocompatibility complex (MHC): peptide binding. The predictions are based on artificial neural networks trained on data from 55 MHC alleles (43 Human and 12 non-human), and position-specific scoring matrices (PSSMs) for additional 67 HLA alleles. As only the MHC class I prediction server is available, predictions are possible for peptides of length 8-11 for all 122 alleles. artificial neural network predictions are given as actual IC(50) values whereas PSSM predictions are given as a log-odds likelihood scores. The output is optionally available as download for easy post-processing. The training method underlying the server is the best available, and has been used to predict possible MHC-binding peptides in a series of pathogen viral proteomes including SARS, Influenza and HIV, resulting in an average of 75-80\% confirmed MHC binders. Here, the performance is further validated and benchmarked using a large set of newly published affinity data, non-redundant to the training set. The server is free of use and available at: http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetMHC.},
