%\section{Summary}

The identification of MHC binding peptides as potential T-cell epitopes has application in peptide vaccine design and immunotherapy. 
Experimental determination of MHC binding is time-consuming and expensive.
Efficient prediction models are required for computational scanning of microbial genome for candidate T cell epitopes. 
These prediction models are either sequence or structure based. 
This review provides a comparative analysis on three sequence based methods for MHC peptide binding classification, 
a position specific scoring matrix (PSSM) and two machine learning methods, support vector machine (SVM) and artificial neural networks (ANN).
